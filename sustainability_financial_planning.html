          Investment Overview
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The total investment for OMSB’s Digital Transformation Program over 2026–2036 is estimated at **OMR 22.216 million**. This budget was carefully derived to cover technology procurement (software licenses, hardware upgrades), cloud services, training and change management programs, staffing needs (including any new hires or consultants for specialized roles), and contingency funds. The funding is planned in alignment with the three phases -
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>**Foundation Phase (2026–2028)** - A significant portion is front-loaded here to build core systems, integrations, and governance structures. For example, costs in this phase include acquiring the unified digital platform (or developing MASAR to full scale), initial cloud migration expenses, integration setup, and hiring a change management team.</li>
            <li>**Optimization Phase (2029–2032)** - Budget shifts towards advanced technology implementations (analytics tools, AI solutions, blockchain infrastructure) and scaling operations. This includes upgrades or expansions to handle increased data/users, and costs for achieving certifications (ISO audits, etc.).</li>
            <li>**Continuous Innovation Phase (2033–2036)** - Investments here focus on innovation initiatives, pilots of new tech, and continuous improvement (like regular system upgrades). By this phase, core investments should taper, with more emphasis on operational budgets for ongoing improvements.</li>
          </ul>
          OMSB will work with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant bodies to secure funding through the government budgeting process, potentially categorized under national digital transformation initiatives or specific grants. Breaking the budget into multi-year tranches helps with government 5-year plan alignments and allows adjustments as needed in later years based on earlier phase outcomes.

          Cost-Benefit and ROI Justification
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          To justify and protect this investment, OMSB will actively track and publicize the returns on investment (**ROI**) from digital projects. This includes both tangible savings (e.g. reduced paper and printing costs, reduced administrative man-hours due to automation, lower server maintenance costs after cloud migration) and intangible benefits (faster service delivery leading to more productive health workforce, improved decision-making impacting health outcomes, etc.). For instance, if automating application processing saves 15 staff hours per week, that can be translated into a cost saving over a year. By **2031**, OMSB expects that efficiency gains will allow it to handle increased workload without proportional increases in staff, effectively absorbing growth at lower cost. Such productivity improvements can be quantified (e.g. if OMSB would have needed 5 more staff by 2031 to handle growth but didn’t because of digital efficiencies, that’s an avoided cost of X OMR per year). Similarly, moving to cloud might avoid large capital expenditures on servers; implementing online services could potentially increase revenue in some areas (e.g. if OMSB introduces a nominal fee for an online verification service used by employers). All these will feed into an ROI analysis. Demonstrating positive ROI helps ensure continued funding support and also helps OMSB make decisions on prioritizing projects (focusing on those with high impact).

          Operational Cost Management
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          While initial investments are high, digital transformation should lower certain ongoing costs. OMSB will closely manage operational expenditures (**OpEx**) for its digital services. Cloud usage will be monitored and optimized – e.g. using auto-scaling to only pay for what is needed, cleaning up unused resources, and using cost-effective cloud options (like reserved instances or government special rates). In fact, one of the strategic objectives is to achieve cost-per-user efficiency gains of **$\geq20\%$ by 2036** through cloud optimization and process improvements. Additionally, as systems consolidate, OMSB can retire legacy systems and their maintenance contracts, channeling those funds into the new platform. Centralizing ICT procurement (through the IT governance board) will allow bulk or enterprise licensing deals that are cheaper than fragmented spends. OMSB will also look for opportunities to utilize shared government services to reduce cost (already planned with using GovCloud, ePayment, etc.) – for example, if the government offers a central AI platform or data lake for multiple entities, using that might be more cost-efficient than building separate ones. The financial plan also accounts for inflation and currency risk if foreign services are used, potentially by locking multi-year contracts at fixed rates where possible.

          Self-Financing and Revenue Generation
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          A distinctive part of OMSB’s sustainability approach is to generate revenue from its digital assets by **2030s**. The MASAR platform (or the suite of OMSB digital modules) could be offered as a service to other bodies regionally. For example, perhaps smaller countries in the region or other professional boards (like nursing or allied health in Oman) could use a white-labeled version of OMSB’s e-portfolio or exam system for their own training programs, for a fee. OMSB could enter a joint-venture or partnership to commercialize some of its solutions (the draft mentions a joint-venture model for MASAR). Even if not fully commercial, OMSB can enter cost-sharing arrangements – say, co-developing certain systems with another Gulf country so that costs are split and both benefit. Another revenue avenue is offering verification services internationally – e.g. charging a small fee for processing international credential verification requests (many boards do this). If blockchain credentials become widely recognized, OMSB might charge issuing or subscription fees for premium verification tools (though any fees would be modest and aligned with public service ethos). The strategy clearly states that by **2036** OMSB’s flagship platform should be self-financing or revenue-generating to ensure it doesn’t become a financial burden. Achieving even partial self-financing will make the digital services more sustainable in the long run, insulating them from budget fluctuations.

          Budget Governance
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Financial oversight will be integrated into the transformation governance. The Steering Committee will review budget status in its meetings, track spending vs. budget, and approve major expenditures. A **rolling 3-year budget plan** will be maintained and updated each year to reflect any changes in priorities or cost structures. This rolling plan means in 2026, OMSB will already budget out to 2029 in detail, in 2027 extend to 2030, and so on – giving foresight and flexibility. If certain projects under-run or free up funds, the committee can reallocate to other needs or bring forward some innovations. Conversely, if some costs escalate, having early warning allows adjustments (either securing extra funds or scaling down some scope). OMSB will also align its budgeting with Oman’s government 5-year development plans to ensure synergy and possibly tap into any special funds (for instance, if there’s a national fund for digital innovation or human capital development, OMSB projects could qualify).

        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Beyond finances, sustainability entails that the systems and processes are maintainable and scalable over time. OMSB will mitigate the risk of systems becoming obsolete by adopting modern, widely-supported technologies (cloud, APIs, etc.) and by ensuring **knowledge transfer** to its own staff so it can maintain systems in-house if needed. The architecture’s **modularity** means if one component becomes outdated, it can be replaced without a full redo. The use of **open standards** ensures OMSB isn’t stuck with dead-end technology. The continuous training of IT staff (digital academy concept) ensures OMSB has the human capacity to sustain the digital environment long-term. For critical proprietary systems, OMSB will always have maintenance contracts or alternate support arrangements to avoid disruptions.

        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          OMSB’s digital move will **reduce paper usage** (supporting environmental goals) and make services more accessible (supporting social inclusion). As Oman places emphasis on sustainability (which Vision 2040 does in terms of socio-economic sustainability), OMSB can highlight that its digital strategy contributes by **reducing carbon footprint** (less travel for in-person tasks, less physical infrastructure via cloud sharing, etc.) and by building a resilient organization that can serve the nation’s needs in the long run. These points can help gather broader support for the initiative as part of Oman’s sustainable development agenda.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed px-6 text-sm-faithful">
        In conclusion, OMSB’s financial and sustainability planning ensures that the digital transformation is not a short-lived initiative but a permanent evolution of the organization. By carefully managing the budget, seeking efficiencies, and creating avenues for the platform to partly fund itself, OMSB aims to maintain its digital systems and services well beyond 2036. This reduces reliance solely on government funding and provides assurance to internal and external stakeholders that investing in this transformation yields lasting value. The digital strategy essentially becomes an enabler for OMSB to do more with prudent resource use – exemplifying the kind of financial and operational excellence that Oman Vision 2040 encourages in public sector entities. With these plans, OMSB is confident that it can achieve its vision by 2036 and continue to innovate and excel in the decades after, without regression or financial shortfall undermining its achievements.
